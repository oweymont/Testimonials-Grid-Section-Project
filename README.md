### What I learned

I used flexbox in designing the page.  Initially, I had to do a trial and error to see which testimonials I can group together to come up with the initial layout. I had to group four of them in a separate container and placed the fifth one in another container. After establishing that, I did the rest with CSS styling.

I tried my best to fill the spaces in each testimonial with the given texts but I still ended up leaving some few spaces. Overall, I found this challenge really helpful in strengthening my knowledge of CSS flexbox and styling.



### Continued development

I want to do a project that will involve Javacript, HTML and CSS so I can integrate all the learnings in one project.

### Useful resources

The readme files and sample pictures of the finished project were really helpful. I also appreciate the inclusion of the source of recommended fonts so I don't have to search for it anymore.
